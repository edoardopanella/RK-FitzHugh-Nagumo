# RK-FitzHugh-Nagumo
This repository contains a numerical study of the FitzHugh–Nagumo (FHN) model, a classical system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations used to describe neuronal excitability and spike generation. The project focuses on the implementation, validation, and application of a fourth-order Runge–Kutta (RK4) method to accurately capture the system’s fast–slow dynamics.

The work was developed as a final project for MATH/CS 514 (Numerical Analysis) and emphasizes both numerical accuracy and qualitative dynamical behavior.
